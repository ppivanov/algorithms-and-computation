This is mine here: For my final year project, I set out to look at business 
continuity and disaster recovery in the cloud. To do this, I looked at all
 options available across the three current leaders in public cloud technologies:
 Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. In each platform,
 I investigated the services available to perform backups etc. and judged them under
 various metrics such as difficulty setting up and cost. As well as that, I also 
looked at two third-party solutions, N2WS and Veeam. With the two third party 
offerings, I investigated what they had to offer in terms of business continuity 
and disaster recovery, if it was easier using them than the services offered by the
 cloud services providers, the ease of setting up these systems (and the cost incurred
 to use them).
